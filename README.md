# Battleship
Here is how to run the game,
I used a macbook for this so I am not sure how it will run on windows, 
but for macbook you will need extensions on vsc to run it, the extnsions needed are, Code Runner by Jun Han, C/C++, the extension pack for C/C++, and CMake Tools
to run it in a file on VS code you will get a terminal file that will be named the same thing when you open that the game will start running
For Windows you can use this link from VSC to learn how to compile and run the game on windows https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
